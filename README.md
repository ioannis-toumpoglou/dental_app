**A dental patient management system**

An application dedicated to assisting dentists in organizing their every day workflow. It offers all the necessary
tools, like booking appointments, keeping track of treatment plans and storing patients' personal data, e.g. x-rays.

The implementation was done using Python and the Django web framework.

The application may be executed either locally or in a Docker container (the Dockerfile plus the docker-compose
file are included).
